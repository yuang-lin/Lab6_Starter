Pad See Ew (which means Stir Fried Soy Sauce noodles) is one of the most popular Thai street foods. Traditionally made with Sen Yai which are wide, thin rice noodles which are not that easy to come by. So use dried rice noodles instead - I&#39;ve eaten enough Pad See Ew at Thai restaurants to assure you that there is no compromise on flavour!KEY TIP FOR SUCCESS: Cook the chicken separately from the noodles. Home stoves are no match for the fierce heat of restaurant and street vendor burners. You have to cook separately to get caramelisation on the noodles which is key for authentic flavour. If you don&#39;t, the noodles will just stew and your dish will lack flavour!","datePublished":"2021-10-28T07:00:00+00:00","image":["https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pad-See-Ew_2-SQ.jpg","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pad-See-Ew_2-SQ.jpg?w=500&h=500&crop=1","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pad-See-Ew_2-SQ.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1","https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pad-See-Ew_2-SQ.jpg?w=480&h=270&crop=1"],"recipeYield":["2","2 - 3 people"],"prepTime":"PT8M","cookTime":"PT10M","totalTime":"PT18M","recipeIngredient":["200g / 7 oz  dried wide rice stick noodles (, or 15 oz / 450g fresh wide flat rice noodles (Sen Yai) (Note 1))","2 tbsp dark soy sauce ((Note 2))","2 tbsp oyster sauce","2 tsp soy sauce ((all purpose or light, Note 3))","2 tsp white vinegar ((plain white vinegar))","2 tsp sugar ((any type))","2 tbsp water","3 tbsp peanut or vegetable oil (, separated)","2 cloves garlic cloves, very finely chopped","1 cup / 150g / 5oz   chicken thighs ((boneless, skinless), sliced (Note 4))","1  large egg","4  stems Chinese broccoli ((Note 5))"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToSection","name":"Preparation:","itemListElement":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Chinese Broccoli - trim ends, cut into 7.5cm/3&quot; pieces.
